# irg-gnd-detection
This repo implemented a ground detection pipeline using the Realsense Camera D435i. The pipline includes depth image processing filters, point cloud conversion between library, normal vector based region growing, post image processing. Use `final.ipynb` to run the pipeline step by step. A bag file (`20191211_160154.bag`) is provided as an example.
